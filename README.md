The folder contains of 5 task files in .py, 4 .sh scripts and other files, such as jupyter notebooks I used to design the extrema() function and the model.

1. taks_1.sh creates a random array of the lenght M*N (3000*1024) and returns the length of an array, the number of local maxima and the number of local minima, the number of extrema per N=1024, too. 

2. task_2.sh creates an random array (M=1000). It plots 4 random sequences of the array with plotly (4 graphs). Local maxima equal 1 and are red, local minima equal -1 and are blue. The array's curve is green. 

3. task_3.sh creastes a pytorch dataset. Returns the destribution of the train, test and val sets. Moreover, it plots these destributions. 

4. there is a file 'classifier.pt' in my google cloud.

5. task_5.sh - creates a random sample and plots y_pred and y_random using plotly.
